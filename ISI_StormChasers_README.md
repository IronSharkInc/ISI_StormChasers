# ISI Storm Chasers

A collection of mods to make storms fun. Storms should not be timeouts.

## Smoothie Durations

Extends the duration of smoothies to 10 minutes (up from 5) so that you can pretend there's enough time to knock out a quest.

## Smoothie Immunity

After getting the biome badge the smoothie for that biome will be upgraded to prevent taking damage from that biome's storms. In other words, if you have the badge, you can chug a smoothie then head out into the storm without taking damage.

_WARNING! Prior to getting the biome badge smoothies will __not__ prevent storm damage!_

## Smoothie Spawns

Drinking a smoothie now summons a small swarm of the zombies for that biome. The zombies are not immediately aggressive, so you might be able to sneak away (if they're far enough away). Makes it easier to hunt the zombies to get the badge. If combined with the Smoothie Immunity it adds some risk back in to storms that isn't completely unavoidable.

## Storm Adjustments

In vanilla storms last for 1.7 to 2.3 in-game hours (depending on the biome). This mod shortens all of them to 1.0 hour. On 60 minute days that means storms last 3 minutes instead of 5 to 7 minutes.

Also lets you adjust how much damage the storm does (down to 10 from 11-14), how frequently the damage ticks (down to 5 seconds from 6 seconds), and how much time you have to hop between shelters (from 11-17 to 15 seconds).
